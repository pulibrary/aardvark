    "blurb": "The Princeton University Library's collections of papyri were acquired from different sources and are mostly preserved in the Manuscripts Division, Department of Rare Books and Special Collections. Princeton acquired 90 papyri from 1901 to 1922 through the Graeco-Roman Branch of the Egypt Exploration Society, but the bulk of Princeton's papyri were acquired in the 1920s, either directly or indirectly through the British Museum. Many were received from 1921 to 1928 through Princeton's participation in a five-member consortium that included Princeton and other universities (Columbia, Cornell, Michigan, University of California at Berkeley, the University of Geneva). Robert Garrett (1875-1961), Class of 1897, partially underwrote Princeton's purchases. and then between 1924 and 1930 independently purchased approximately 750 Egyptian papyri through the British Museum for his own manuscript collection, which was first deposited in the Library for scholarly use and publication, then formally donated in 1942 with the rest of the Garrett Collection. There are more than a thousand pieces in Princeton's collections. Best known are Princeton's literary, early Christian, and sub-literary papyri. Among authors represented are Aristophanes, Demosthenes, Euripides, Herodotus, Hippocrates, Homer, Isocrates, Theocritus, and Xenophon. But a much larger number are Greek documentary papyri, including census and tax registers, military lists, land convey¬ances, business records, petitions, private letters, and other sources of historical and paleographic interest from Ptolemaic (332-30 BCE), Roman (30 BCE-300 CE), and Byzantine Egypt (300-650 CE). Nearly all were discovered from the 1890s to the 1920s, buried or recovered from mummy cartonnage in and around the ancient Egyptian town of Oxyrhynchus and the Fayum towns. The Princeton collections also include papyri in Egyptian languages (Hieroglyphic, Hieratic, Demotic, and Coptic); Arabic papyri from the Islamic period (from 640 CE); and a smaller number of Latin papyri from Roman Egypt and Ravenna."

    "blurb": "The ephemeral collection of very rare 30 block prints fall into several categories: some are color prints with a minimum of text, others are black and white illustrated sheets, some of which include current news, while others have a more general content. The news sheets were issued in Shanghai , when news of the 1911 Revolution in Wuhan was telegraphed to print agencies in Shanghai. The latter immediately printed illustrated sheets for a Chinese public avid for the latest news; the illustrations themselves may therefore be based upon artists imagination. The sheets generally support the Revolution as a modernizing party, and hence some demonization of the enemy occurs in the prints, as was usual for propaganda prints of that and earlier periods. The collection is useful for investigations into the visual portrayal of the struggle of Han Chinese versus the Manchus during the 1911 overthrow of the Qing Empire. Issues of \"modernity\" and \"nation\" are easily visible in the prints. The collection also includes one Japanese block print dating from 1914. The collection was given in 1937 to Princeton Library by Donald Roberts, class of 1909, who was an Episcopalian minister who taught history at St. John's University in Shanghai from 1915 to 1950. Comparison with earlier Chinese anti-Christian, or Japanese anti-Chinese or anti-Russian prints made during the Sino-Japanese and Russo-Japanese wars may be instructive. The Princeton East Asian Library in no way supports the rhetoric or depictions that are presented on the prints."

    "title": "Japanese Prints and Drawings in the Cotsen Collection",
    "blurb": "This collection is a digital showcase of Japanese prints and drawings held at the Cotsen Children\u2019s Library. Spanning from the Edo Period (1600-1868) to the first half of the twentieth century, this collection contains hand-painted scrolls, game boards (sugoroku), woodblock prints, pictorial maps, classroom wall charts, and playing cards (iroha karuta). The game boards were selected from a total of around 300 sheets of sugoroku held at Cotsen, a rare collection comparable to the few existing in Japan. A dice-based game, sugoroku has entertained the Japanese for centuries. A wide range of topics and themes can be found in the heavily illustrated game boards, which served not only for recreation but also for the dissemination of information, commercial advertising, literacy education, moral and political socialization, and militarist propaganda targeting children and adults alike."

    "title": "Print Ephemera from the 2013 Moscow Mayoral Election",
    "blurb": "The 2013 Moscow mayoral election was in many ways a barometer for a particular moment in the volatile balance between a longstanding authoritarian federal regime and opposition forces in Russia\u2019s capital, a barometer for the attitudes and reactions of a new urban middle class bristling under authoritarian rule. It stood as an index of the extent to which that class held and was willing to mobilize political capital, and the extent to which the larger population in Moscow was prepared to mount and support opposition to the regime. In 2013 Alexei Navalny, a Moscow mayoral candidate openly hostile to the Kremlin, managed to run and to become the most serious challenger of the Kremlin-backed incumbent Sergei Sobyanin. There had long been a general perception that high-ranking elected municipal officials, and particularly those in the more populous urban centers, were de facto Kremlin installations who ran in the absence of any serious contest. Alexei Navalny had been a participant of some notoriety in the groundswell of protest and opposition which was set in motion following the State Duma Elections in 2011 and surged after the Presidential Election of 2012, and in 2013 he decided to run as a mayoral candidate in Moscow. He was ultimately not able to unseat the Kremlin-backed incumbent and thwart the Kremlin's larger political objective for the 2013 Moscow mayoral election. He did, however, receive financial backing from representatives of Moscow's new monied professional and entrepreneurial classes and succeeded in waging a vigorous and visible campaign and posing a significant challenge to the incumbent. That a rogue candidate was able to achieve this in Russia's federal administrative capital and most populous city was seen by many as evidence that the Kremlin was no longer able to maintain its monopoly on political power. After declaring his candidacy Navalny was arrested and briefly imprisoned on what many saw as dubious charges, but his release less than 24 hours later was widely registered as a sea-change in Russian politics - a sign that the rogue candidate Navalny had managed to garner enough visibility and popular support to make his imprisonment politically inexpedient for the Kremlin, had succeeded in embarrassing the administration, forcing its hand and posing a formidable challenge to its chosen candidate for the Moscow mayoral seat. This collection contains just over 180 pieces of print ephemera documenting the verbal and graphic languages deployed in the propaganda struggle that accompanied the 2013 Moscow mayoral contest."

    "title": "Soviet Era Books for Children and Youth",
    "blurb": "This digital collection represents 46 imprints from the Russian holdings of the Cotsen Children\u2019s Library. All of the selections in this group were produced between 1918 and 1938 and present examples of the visual and verbal idioms artists and authors used to address the country\u2019s children and youth in the first two decades after the October Revolution. They display a range of visual and verbal efforts to represent the tumultuous first 2 decades of the Twentieth Century in Russia and their culmination in the cataclysmic events of 1917, as well as to communicate ideological orientation and inculcate the values of a new society that was itself still at an early developmental stage. In terms of technique, the selections feature verse and prose aimed at readers ranging from early childhood to mid adolescence, as well as paint, drawing, photomontage, and, in a few cases, the kind of creative typography characteristic of early Twentieth-Century Russian avant-garde writers and artists such as Ilya Zdanevich and Velimir Khlebnikov. Examples of fanciful or experimental formats in this collection include the elaborate fold-out book Пятилетка (\u201cFive-year plan\u201d) and a \u201cКнижка-киносеанс\u201d (\u201cbook-movie\u201d) \u2013 a book that includes instructions for its own deconstruction and reassembly as a film and building a makeshift projector for its display. These 46 books - which include work by the artist Vladimir Lebedev, Soviet children\u2019s poet Agniya Barto, and poets Aleksandr Bezymenskii, Vladimir Mayakovsky and Daniil Kharms - were chosen as particularly interesting and/or representative specimens from the Cotsen collection\u2019s holdings of almost 1,000 Russian children\u2019s books published between the 1917 Revolution and the beginning of WWII. The Cotsen\u2019s Russian holdings total over 1,800 titles with imprint dates from the mid-Seventeenth Century to the present."

The inventory of Count Leopoldo\u2019s library, published in 1821 as the Catalogo ragionato dei libri d\u2019arte e d\u2019antichità, has been reprinted many times and remains an essential tool for scholars and bibliophiles.

They are also considered to be one of the significant American publishers in terms of sustained technical and marketing innovations during this important era in publishing history. McLoughlin Bros. publisher\u2019s catalogs and marketing materials provide important research tools for those interested in the history of children\u2019s book publishing and the business and marketing activity of a major American publisher. Dating McLoughlin Bros. titles is notoriously difficult. Many McLoughlin books are undated; titles were also reissued over and over again, often with changed inventory numbers from one time-period to the next, keying revisions and different issue dates. Publisher\u2019s catalogs are the only source for identifying and itemizing the company\u2019s changing inventory numbers and revisions of exiting titles, as the firm constantly revised and expanded its product lines of books and children\u2019s\u2019 toys. The Cotsen Children\u2019s Library holds one of the largest aggregations of McLoughlin Brothers\u2019 catalogs, many from the firm\u2019s own business office and publisher\u2019s archive, uniquely annotated with information about new editions, changes in illustrations, or new series. In addition, Cotsen holds ten large scrap-book-style \u201cguard-books\u201d containing proof copies of illustrations for books, many extensively hand-annotated by McLoughlin Bros. editorial or production staff."

They include 18 of the 20 plates illustrating the 1676 Description de la grotte de Versailles, chiefly engraved by Jean Le Pautre (1618-1682). Captioned in French and Latin, these plates represent an architectural grotto built in 1666 adjacent to the palace, with particular iconography of sea-nymphs, tritons and the sun-god. The name of the architect of the grotto is not certainly known although Charles Perrault claimed that it was designed by himself and his brother Claude. The sculptors named on the plates are Gerard van Opstal, François Girardon, Thomas Regnaudin, Gaspar et Balthasar de Marsy, Gilles Guérin and Jean-Baptiste Tuby. After the destruction of the grotto in 1684 the statuary was relocated to other parts of the gardens."
